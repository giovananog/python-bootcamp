# Caesar Cipher Python Project

This is a simple Python program that allows you to encode and decode messages using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique that shifts letters in the alphabet by a specified number of positions.

## How to Use

1. Start the program by running the Python script.

```python
python your_script.py
```

2. You will be prompted with the Caesar Cipher program logo and asked if you want to encode or decode a message.

3. Type 'encode' to encrypt a message or 'decode' to decrypt a message.

4. Enter the message you want to encode or decode.

5. Enter the shift value, which determines how much the letters will be shifted in the alphabet.

6. The program will display the encoded or decoded message.

7. You will be asked if you want to continue encoding or decoding. Type 'y' to continue and 'n' to exit the program.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:

1. Type 'encode' to encrypt a message.

2. Enter the message: "hello".

3. Enter the shift value: 3.

4. The program will display the encoded message: "khoor".

5. You can choose to continue encoding or decoding or exit the program.

## About the Code

This program is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

- `replit`: This library is used for clearing the console screen.
- `art`: It's used to display the program logo.

The `caeser` function performs the encoding and decoding, and the program provides a simple text-based interface to interact with it.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different messages and shift values to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher.

Have fun using the Caesar Cipher Python program!
